Hi, I am Lei Yang (杨磊), Raymond is my English name!

Nice to meet you here! This is my blog to note my life and some technical posts. I love ski, movies (big fan of Christopher Nolan), reading (a nerd of history), video games (DOTA2).

Here is a short story about me!

Shanghai -> Boston -> Seattle.

Shanghai is the place I was born and grown up. I finished my college degree in Tongji University on Software Engineering major, and started my career as a software engineer in [QAD][13].

QAD is a multinational corporation focusing on ERP software development. This is the place where I learned day to day software development work, team collaboration, and transformed my mindset from a school to profession.

Later, I decided to pursue my master degree, this starts a new charpter of my life.

Boston is the place I landed in United States. I pursued my master degree in Computer Science in Boston University. It's a beautiful city in summer, and really cooooold in winter. I learned ski there, which became my favorite sports later!

After graduation, I moved to Seattle and started my job as a software development engineer in Amazon Ads Targeting. It was challenging and fulfilling two years. From struggling finishing my first task to leading and launching a big projects; from shy to speak out in standup to host cross team design reviews. There were tons of memories and growings!

In 2020, I decided to start a new career in [Qualtrics][3]. Qualtrics is an experience management platform and I was offered the chance to build the high scale targeting system (continue my technical journey in Ads Targeting System), There was a big debate in my mind at that time, and eventually I made up my mind to take the adventure and experience something different!

After three years' thriving, now, I am currently serving as a senior software engineer and tech lead in digitial experience platform in Qualtrics!
